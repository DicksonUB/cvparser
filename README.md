**CV PARSER** \n
Job seekers often encounter the problem of having to prepare a CV for looking for a job and then they find that they have to re-enter all of the details that are already inside the CV file again witch makes it tedious.
They have to do this because often companies want to know details that maybe they may have left out on the CV or to organize the candidates data for filtering processes.
CV parser is a suggestion for job recruiting portals to solve/streamline this process.
This app extracts the text from the pdf file/cv introced and autofills the fields with what it thinks is appropiate to every field according to its label.
